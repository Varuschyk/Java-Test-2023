# Test Java 2023

## Security - Manager/Client
```
Unfortunately, I was partially unable to 
complete the assignment requirement. 
Because for unknown reasons to me, 
the security configuration behaves strangely.
```

## E2E Tests
```
I created only one test scenario as example. 
I didn't describe each scenario, since this would be 
too cumbersome and would take a lot of time.
```

## Build

---

cd path/to/project/

./mvnw clean install
